Hmisc:
------
Hmisc is listet as a dependency because ggplot2's mean_sdl depends on it, yet
its not listed as a dependency of ggplot2. If mean_sdl() is called and Hmisc
is not available, mean_sdl() will attempt to *install* Hmisc. If no CRAN mirror
was selected previously, this will prompt the user to select on, and block the
process until the user responds. If that happends from the SAN model explorer
shiny app, the app appears to be frozen until the user realizes that the line
"Selection:" that appears on the R console demands that a mirror be selected.
