organoidsizes.tab, 10.9.2020:
Data in organoidsizes.tab is based H9_WT_sizes_area_measurments.xslx, which was converted to
the tab-separated file H9_WT_sizes_area_measurments.tab, and on the FACS counts from cellcounts.tab per
23.06.2020. The data was processed with the following R snippet to generate organoidsizes.tab:
  ta <- data.table(read.table("data/H9_WT_sizes_area_measurments.tab", sep="\t", header=T, check.names=F))[, list(
    day=as.integer(substr(`Day`, 4, 6)), source="area", rep=paste0("b", trimws(substr(`Batch`, 6, 8))), count=`Volume`
  )]
  tf <- data.table(read.table("data/cellcounts.tab", header=TRUE, sep="\t"))[, list(
    day, source="facs", rep, count
  )]
  # Scaling factor is based on the (interpolated) FACS count for day 10.
  # The 'hq' column indicates which estimates are "high-quality" and should be used
  s <- exp((3/4)*mean(tf[day==9, log(count)])+(1/4)*mean(tf[day==13, log(count)])-mean(ta[day==10, log(count)]))
  t <- rbind(tf, ta[, list(day, source, rep, count=round(s*count))])[, list(
    day, source, rep, count, hq=((source=="facs") & (day < 25)) | (source=="area")
  )]
  write.table(t[order(day, source, rep, hq, count)], file="data/organoidsizes.tab", sep="\t", quote=F, row.names=F)
Note that averaging and fitting were all performed in the logspace, this should reduce the effect
of any outliers that may be present, and is consistant with logarithmic plotting and errorbars.
Variances can also be assumed to be more homogenous in logspace for this dataset.
